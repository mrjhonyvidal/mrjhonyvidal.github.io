## Still preparing the post and files...

## What we will build? ##

We're going to build a Subscription System API for Online Services using [REST](https://spring.io/understanding/REST) and PHP Laravel 5.6.

The API will implement different Payment Gateways like (Stripe and PayPal), it contains User Authentication and Registration using OAuth - JWT protocol for security. 

The code source and online API can be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/elephwebb/laravel-test-driven-rest-api) and you can contribute if you want.

Here is the [KANBAN](https://trello.com/b/FVryIUaW) of the project.
